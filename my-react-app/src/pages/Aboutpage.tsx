      <h1>Rick and Morty</h1>
      <p>
        Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science-fiction sitcom created by Justin
        Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Networks nighttime programming block Adult Swim. It is
        distributed internationally by Warner Bros. Television Distribution. The series follows the
        misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical mad scientist, and his good-hearted but fretful
        grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional
        adventures that take place across an infinite number of realities, often traveling to other
        planets and dimensions through portals and on Ricks flying saucer. The general concept of
        Rick and Morty relies on two conflicting scenarios: domestic family drama, and an alcoholic
        grandfather dragging his grandson into hijinks.
        <br /> Roiland voiced the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and
        Sarah Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and Mortys family. The series originated from an
        animated short parody film of Back to the Future created by Roiland for Channel 101, a
        short-film festival cofounded by Harmon. Since its debut, the series has received critical
        acclaim for its originality, creativity, and humor. It has been nominated for three
        Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program and won the award in 2018 and 2020.
        The series has also received two Annie Awards. At times, the series has been the most viewed
        television comedy for adults between 18 and 24. The popularity of Rick and Morty has made it
        a hundred-million dollar merchandising and media franchise. <br />
        The sixth season premiered on September 4, 2022, and consists of ten episodes. A seventh
        season was confirmed as part of a long-term deal with Cartoon Network that ordered 70 new
        episodes, which renewed the series through to a tenth season. In January 2023, Adult Swim
        cut ties with Roiland amid allegations of domestic abuse, and announced it would be
        recasting his roles.
